    <h1>Assignment 6</h1>
   <div>
    In the Account section of the kanbas navbar, I have added 2 buttons: Sign in and Sign up. If you sign in/sign up, then it takes you to the account 
    where you can edit the details or signout. It also has a users button, which takes you to the users table. Clicking on the user name takes you to the user profile. 
    You can also edit or delete the users.
<br/>

If a user is signed in, the account section of the navbar will directly take the user to the account details.
   </div>
    </>

    export default Assignment6;
